# ESPHOME-ITHO
 ESPHOME version of the ESPEASY-ITHO plugin. This is code i reworked form https://github.com/CoMPaTech/esphome_c1101 
 The code missed some things i had available in the ESPEASY ITHO plugin
 
 Added:
 - Timer value is counting down when a timer function is activated
 - Extra textsensor to identify the device that had issued the state change of the fan.
 

 
## ESPHOME version ≥2025.2.0
From version 2025.2.0, custom components are no longer supported (see https://esphome.io/changelog/2025.2.0). Instead we need to use external components, for which the code can reside local or in the cloud. Code has been rewritten to use local external components.
